                <p>Welcome to my developer portfolio. This is a place for me to show all of my developer projects.
                    I was born 30 years ago in New Orleans, Louisiana but have lived in Charlotte for the last 24 years.
                    After attending some college I worked numerous jobs including fine dining cook, turf management and tennis operations
                    at a country club. Tennis has always been a passion of mine and coming back to the game opened new opportunities for me.
                    Eventually I was able to join a local Tennis Pro in opening up a specialty pro shop. In 5 years the business has grown tremendously
                    and we have now expanded to a second location. The challenges of running a small business is real and there is a lack of
                    assistance from technology. I hope to learn to skills to solve some of the deficanies I want to fix. Now I am going to list some meats.
  
                    Ham frankfurter buffalo kevin pork. Porchetta ham turducken meatloaf ham hock. Short loin chuck tri-tip shankle frankfurter.
